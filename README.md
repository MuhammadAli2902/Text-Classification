# Text-Classification
Text Classification project classify Disaster and Non-Disaster tweets .The Dataset was taken from kaggle[https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data]
A series if total 7 experiments were run on the data and the best performance model was selected to be tested on 
##We have builed the following:

* Model 0: Naive Bayes (baseline)
* Model 1: Feed-forward neural network (dense model)
* Model 2: LSTM model
* Model 3: GRU model
* Model 4: Bidirectional-LSTM model
* Model 5: 1D Convolutional Neural Network
* Model 6: TensorFlow Hub Pretrained Feature Extractor
* Model 7: Same as model 6 with 10% of training data

## To keep track of experiments all model logs have been uploaded to tensorbrard can be acsessed through this link:

For projection we have also added metadata and vectors.
